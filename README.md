# Eclipse-Maven collaboration project

This project demonstrates some semi-automatic technics that allow:

  1. Build platform-dependent Eclipse distribution with pre-installed bundles and/or features for both Windows/Linux platforms
  2. Distribute plugins that meant to be build using Maven in **completely offline** mode.


## Where to begin

After you clone the repository, follow futher instructions listed:

  * Building Eclipse distribution - [[Eclipse README](eclipse/README.md)]
  * Building plugins in offline using Maven - [[Plugins README](plugins/README.md)]
